	<h1>Time of Day</h1>

	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
	<h2 id="time">Morning</h2>
	<p>When you’re up against a trouble,
    Meet it squarely, face to face;
    Lift your chin and set your shoulders,
    Plant your feet and take a brace.
    When it’s vain to try to dodge it,
    Do the best that you can do;
    You may fail, but you may conquer,
    See it through!</p>
    
</div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    
	<h2 id="time">Noon</h2>
	<p >Black may be the clouds about you
    And your future may seem grim,
    But don’t let your nerve desert you;
    Keep yourself in fighting trim.
    If the worst is bound to happen,
    Spite of all that you can do,
    Running from it will not save you,
    See it through!</p>

</div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
		
	<h2 id="time">Night</h2>
	<p>Even hope may seem but futile,
    When with troubles you’re beset,
    But remember you are facing
    Just what other men have met.
    You may fail, but fall still fighting;
    Don’t give up, whate’er you do;
    Eyes front, head high to the finish.
    See it through!</p>
